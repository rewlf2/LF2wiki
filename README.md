## Contributing

There are several ways you can contribute:

### Character info

This wiki is building character info on basis of a fighting game knowledge base.

The following data is needed:
* Character basic parameters like walking and running speed
* Move parameters like startup and damage.
* Basic versus matchups, including Deep's jumpA counters Grab chain moves

To begin with, you can use any LF2 data changer and view the information 

### Fighting game-related glossary

Will need a list of vocabulary enclosing all the techniques involved in playing original LF2,
for example, Deep's wallbang combo will need a vocabulary to describe it properly.

### History of LF2 community

Need to expand the list of LF2 community and history pages.
What are exactly required:

* Forum pages, posts and websites involving history of LF2 community
* Famous community and basic information
** It is recommended to include region, languagem feature and host of community

The material are required to be written in Chinese, English or Japanese. You may also pull from the project and write on pages right away.

Images will be included within my discretion.
