**Leviaiz (Rewlf2)**

Dating back to 2009, initially known as Rewlf2, named after his first LF2 mod Reality Little Fighters, was fascinated by R-LF2 and C-LF2, and created an overpowered modification, published in the now closed ztage forum (named LF2 official forum at that time) and got heavily criticized. After 1 year of remaking the game, it was again published but still received mediocre reception.

At that time a complete rebuild of this game began, named LF2 Hetero Clash (LF2HC), built from original game but still plays like R-LF2, although much less overpowered and polished, Rewlf2 received feedbacks that the balance and technique of original LF2 still lacks in the version. Under several LF2 players' advice including STM93, he began rebuilding the game (again) and make it much more similar to the original LF2, named LF2: Story of HongBa.

Under several players and modders' advices, Leviaiz finally manages to create a mod with much respect to the mechanics of LF2. In the progress of making the 3 games, he also learned on modding many aspects of the game, including altering advertisement, making new backgrounds, characters, game interface and image/audit processing skills like using Audacity.

His improvement on modding LF2 would extend to a dedicated direction: Extended Data Changing, which involves modifying .dat files in LF2 programs to achieve undiscovered effects. After the first mechanism-based character: Furrzee was created, he dedicated himself in pursuing advanced DC technology and making a few side-products along.

Examples include Killis, a Dennis with a counter system who unlocks his move with DJA command, Winnie, A wind-based female inspired by Windy in LFO, who drains her health to use her move, and Keny, a boss character who fuses several exclusive systems: heavy weapon armor (grant a new state in expense of disable using heavy weapon), Single-sided Defense System (a jointed effort with STM93, this allows character to block attacks in the front for new characters).

In overall, Leviaiz now stands as an all-around LF2 modder, and also has a little skill in playing, which he sometimes posts youtube videos on his new characters and gameplay.
