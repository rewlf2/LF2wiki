# Template
![Template portrait](./images/moves/template/template_face.png)

Template is the only character in LF2 who does not appear as an enemy in Stage mode.
It is also the only character not locked behind password, but unselectable by Random at the same time.

It is expected as a sample character and is approximately as strong as Bandit.

## Basic moves

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![A image](./images/moves/template/template_a.png) | 2 | 4 | 0 | 20 | 20 | None

Stuns in 3 hits. Due to hitbox lasting until end of move, if Template damages enemy after first tu of active hitbox, its next punch can hit earlier.
