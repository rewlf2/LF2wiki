# Template
![Template portrait](https://i.imgur.com/aaS4f3g.png)

Template is the only character in LF2 who does not appear as an enemy in Stage mode.
It is also the only character not locked behind password, but unselectable by Random at the same time.

It is expected as a sample character and is approximately as strong as Bandit.

| In Random | Locked by password | Stage mode | Battle mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No | No | No appearance | No appearance

Stuns in 3 hits. Due to hitbox lasting until end of move, if Template damages enemy after first tu of active hitbox, its next punch can hit earlier.

| ![runA image](https://i.imgur.com/F7owre1.png) | 5 | 6 | 4 | 70 | 60 | 20 | None

Poor startup and hits single enemy, possibly the worst runA in game. Only usable as read and overshadowed by runWA.

| ![dashA image](https://i.imgur.com/daMNHR2.png) | 3 | 21 | 0 | 70 | 60 | 70 | None

The only engage/disengage tool without weapon. Has an absurd active but is only fair among all characters.

Very similar to Bandit jumpA. Can abuse to stunlock single enemy. Not viable as engage.
