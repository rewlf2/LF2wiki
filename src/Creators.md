## Little Fighter and pre-LF era

Little Fighter 2 was written in 1999-2002 by Marti Wong and Starsky Wong, Computer Science students of Chinese University of Hong Kong. They are very good friends (not brothers though). The game was basically written in C++, using DirectX library, and all figures in the game were drawn by Marti Wong.

From 1990, Marti Wong had been creating games in QBasic, including Fight and Leo. Some characters eventually evolved into the characters in LF2, including Billy in Fighter leading to Davis, John, Mark and Louis. It's not until the development of Little Fighter 1 in 1995 that Marti learned to program in C, which solved many problems in QBasic.

Due to matching compatibility to new Windows OS, LF2 was programmed in C++. The game engine of LF2 was also presented as the product of their Final Year Project, which expectedly resulted in an A grade.

LF2 is a free game, as the creator stated they want any people to play the game, even for ones who have problem with money. They had some chance to sell the copyright to some company, but they finally reject them. However, they stated they have no plans to release the source of the game. Although Marti knew about the editing programs in LF2, he forgot about the names and never hosted them in the official website.

At the end of development of LF2, Marti went to establishing his career, giving rise to various LF2 spinoffs including Little Fighter Online and Hero Fighter, while Starsky went to the UCLA United States to continue studies. Later, both of them were employed in Facebook and Google, although it is unknown if they met each other in work.

## Little Fighter Online era

Marti was then employed in a company and created several mobile games in 2002-2004, which make handsome revenue for the company, but Marti was not largely benefited from it. Dissatisfied with his work, he joined hands with Oscar Chu, CEO of U1 technology in 2004 and granted the right to develop the first online LF2-based MMORPG: Little Fighter Online. LFO was a consistent participant of Ani-Com, the yearly festival of anime, comic and games in Hong Kong from 2006 to 2011. However, Marti fell out of U1 technology before August 2006, and worked in Microsoft for 2 years.

## Hero Fighter era

Marti stated although work in corporations was profitable, it would waste his time from doing what he wanted to, and he resigned in Aug 2008, starting development of a new game, Hero Fighter. Although he gave himself a 2-year deadline, urging himself to give up if it failed, its development lasted for 7 years. On 31 Jul 2009, the first playable version of HF was released.

HF was largely oriented in battle mode, which featured riding system, advanced blocking, stamina and was more suitable in large-scale battles, compared to LF.

It relied on purchase of premium accounts and advertisement to generate revenue, which granted him a full year of income until two devastating events happened: Chinese hackers released an unlocked version of HF on web free of charge, and the advertisement sponsor of HF being dissolved, causing most of income being annihiliated. Marti had to rely in freelance jobs to keep on his life and being depressed, it caused 2 years of inactivity of LF2-related creations.

In 2015, being both desperate and weary of repeated failures, he tried in creating the sequel of HF: Hero Fighter X, which ran in mobile devices. He claimed he would give up creating games and take job if it failed again. While HF was successful initially, once ranked first in Hong Kong iOS app games, 4th in Taiwan and 17th in China, the emergence of pirated games crippled his income again, forcing him to take contract job.

Marti said that the development of HFX added many elements leading to purchases, and he was losing the joy of developing games due to overthinking about profit. He never was fully willing to develop such pay-to-play games which players compete by amount of money spent, instead of strategy and skill.

## LF remster / NFT era

On 16 Mar 2021, Marti Wong announced the Little Fighter NFT project, a fund raising project to support the development of upcoming Little Fighter remaster, along with the news of LF remaster. He registered patreon account and posted in his twitter account about both of them.

Marti Wong claimed he gained profit by seling some other NFTs and craeted LF-related NFTs for auction, including LF1 style character icons.

In Patreon, he announced an election for style rebrand of LF2 remastered, and the new design was confirmed shortly after, which Marti was then releasing artwork about restyled characters until now. Marti Wong stated the game would take 15-18 months to be published, programmed in Unity, run in Windows, mac and mobiles platform, and uses a pay-to-unlock model of revenue, which players can purchase exclusive characters.

On 24 Jun 2021, Marti minted a NFT artwork of LF2: "The source code", which the whole LF1 source code was written in the image, colored and the overall picture is a portrait of LF2 Julian.
