# About LF2

Little Fighter 2 (LF2; Chinese: 小朋友齊打交2) is a Hong Kong freeware PC fighting game for Windows and is the sequel to the game Little Fighter. Little Fighter 2 was created by Marti Wong and Starsky Wong in 1999, and received a long series of updates.

The game supports up to 4 human players on one computer and a total of 8 characters using online play or computer-controlled opponents. Characters are controlled using the keyboard or a gamepad. All keys can be custom set via a configuration menu.

## Characters

LF2 features 10 main, 4 hidden boss, 9 minions and 1 template characters. The main characters are often called "Heroes" or "Fighters" by players and fans. (Any character is a "fighter" according to character selection screen though.) Many characters are based on popular ACG products at that time, including Songoku and Seiya, and some characters are based on same or similar-named characters in previous games created by Marti Wong.

## Spinoff products

All the characters were featured in various spinoff media products, including artwork, fanfiction and animations. Famous products include Bandep comic, LF2 Julian War animation and 新世紀降魔傳 fanfiction.

## Expert player groups

The balance of LF2 was never thoroughly tested, as mentioned by Marti Wong, the strength of moves were only rated with undisclosed score to ensure the game was not broken.

Nevertheless, the innovative playing style of mixing fighting game and beat'em up has given rise to a very high skill ceiling, and to explore the possiblities of the game, many early gamers craeted social groups, held tournaments, created custom rules and rating systems, building the first communities within several forums like HKLFF. 

### Data changing

The data changing community never started until Jiquera Mondilano, a Philipine programmer discovered a way to  decrypt the close-sourced .dat files inside LF2 program. Before that, data modification was limited to swapping data files and modifying data.txt, an index file inside LF2 program folder.

The discovery of decryption has led Jiquera to create the first data changer, named lf2_dc_v1.4, and this program can readily modify .dat files quickly. Although Marti Wong did not approve of this, he took no legal action against it.

The widespread of this program led to an immense burst of the data changing community, leading to thousands of modified characters, backgrounds, and creation of mechanics unexpected in the original game. It also improved the popularity of the original game, although the data changer community would soon develop a bitter relationship with the expert player groups.

### Exe file changing

The earliest modified exe available is suspected to be "LF2 XP", a lf2 v1.9 game program swapped with silvery interface graphic. It was created in 1 Jan 2004.

Many modified programs are published, famous ones include Alcarter's exe which includes many new functions like real-time loading, NTSD's exe specialized for the NTSD mod, allowing characters to run on walls, and Leaf's exe which also has new gimmicks.

Some programs are specialized in changing the graphics, resulting in completely different outlook, like NTSD, LF2 Rhythm of Night and LF2: Story of HongBa.
